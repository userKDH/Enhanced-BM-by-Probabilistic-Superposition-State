# Enhanced-BM-by-Probabilistic-Superposition-State
We provide the original code of the combinatorial optimization problems (COPs) addressed in our manuscript and supplemental material — including the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), Max-Cut, and the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) — along with the corresponding solvers: stationary_PSS_BM, nonstationary_PSS_BM, and the simulated annealing benchmark.

We also provide the problem instances used in our study: TSP instances are sourced from TSPLIB, Max-Cut instances from the Biq Mac Library, and CVRP instances from CVRPLIB.

All parameters used in the code match those in our paper. Feel free to modify the code for testing purposes—just make sure to update the input/output file paths to ensure proper execution.
